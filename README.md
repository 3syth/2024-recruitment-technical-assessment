# DevSoc 2024 Subcommittee Recruitment Technical Assessment

Howdy! 
Thank you for applying to DevSoc project teams for 2024. Our projects are proudly maintained by student society volunteers like yourself who for many years have ideated, built and iterated the websites within our portfolios.

To complete this assessment, you will need to [fork and clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository), implement and push your solutions to GitHub, and submit a link to your fork in the application form.

See each of the subdirectories (`backend`, `frontend` and `chaos`) for the relevant assessments. Please **carefully** read the submission instructions - if we are unable to access your solutions, we cannot consider them in the recruitment process.
